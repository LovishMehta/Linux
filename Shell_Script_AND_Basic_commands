"$" stands for => Command Prompt

While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.
Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines the command you want executed by looking at the first word of your input.

E.g $ date // it will display date

Shell Scripts
***************
=> The basic concept of a shell script is a list of commands, which are listed in the order of execution.
   (similarly to program in C ,as C programs also get executed line by line from begining to end)

=> "#", hash is used to write comments in shell script.

=> Shell scripts are simple text file in which we would put all our commands and several other required constructs that tell 
   the shell environment what to do and when to do it.
(NOTE: Shell scripts and functions are both interpreted. This means they are not compiled.)\

 How to write a Shell Script?
1. Firstly we need to alert the system that a shell script is being started. This is done using the shebang construct (#!/bin/sh)
   (symbol "#"  stands for "hash" and Symbol "!" stands for "bang" tht's why called "shebang".)
2. Then we write the data and commands in the script.

(Note: All the scripts would have the .sh extension. Example "test.sh" )
