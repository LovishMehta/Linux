read statement takes input and stores in some varible

=> Single read
 
 read name
 echo "NAME is : $name"   // echo is similar to println
 
=> Multiple Read

 read name1 name2 name3
 echo "NAMES : $name1, $name2, $name3"

************************
Flags for taking input
************************
 
=>  "-p" flag let us enter the input on same line or we can same prompt
  
  read -p 'username :' user_name   // this will take the input on same line
  echo "Name is : $user_name"
  
=> "-s" this will flag lets the system read "silently" i.e. without displaying on the screen
 
   read -sp 'password : ' pass_var
   echo "password is: $pass_var"
   
=> "-a" this flag tells the system to read an "ARRAY"

   read -a names
   echo "NAmes : ${names[0]}, ${names[1]}"
   
 NOTE: if write "read" without any variable then the input goes into built in variable called "REPLY"
 
 Example:
 
 echo "Enter name"
 read
 echo "NAmes: $REPLY"
