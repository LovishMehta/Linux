There are two types of variables
1. System Varibles : Most likely these variables are defined in capital letters
   Example : 
    1. BASH => gives the name of shell
    2. BASH_VERSION => gives version of the bash
    3. HOME => this will give home directory
    4. PWD => this gives the present working directory in which you are working.
    etc.
    
2. User defined variables : these are generally created using lower case, can also be in upper case
 
   the variable name is same as it used to be in c, the rukes for giving variable name are same as C.
   Example => name. student , book etc
    use => read name // value get stored in name
    
   To print use $ symbol before variable name
    Example => echo "The name is $name"
    
  To write comment use symbol "#"
